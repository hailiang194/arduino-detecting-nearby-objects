## Install
1. clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/53k41iga/arduino-detecting-nearby-objects.git
```
2. second, vetify get-data/get-data.ino then upload it into Arduino

## Implementation
after installing into arduino, connect it to computer by USB and run main.py on terminal, cmd or Powershell
```
python main.py
```
At the present, it just can speak about the nearest object detected in Vietnamese in the future I will create a radar display on computer sceen.
